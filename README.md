## Project Name

Rutgers-Crime-Campus-Watch-Dash-App

## Access the Dash App

You can access the deployed Dash app [here](https://campuswatch.azurewebsites.net/.). The app is compatible with both mobile and desktop devices.

## Purpose

The Campus Watch Dashboard is a data visualization project designed to showcase the capabilities of Dash, a Python framework for building analytical web applications. It provides insights into crime incidents reported on a university campus, allowing users to explore and analyze the data interactively.

## Key Features

- Visualize crime density on an interactive map
- Filter crime incidents by type, status, and date range
- Display data summary statistics, including total crimes and average crime rate
- Analyze top crime types with a bar chart visualization

## Technologies

- Python
- Dash (for building the web application)
- Plotly (for interactive data visualizations)
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- Bootstrap (for styling)

## Usage

To use the Campus Watch Dashboard:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Dash application with `python app.py`.
4. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8050` to access the dashboard.

Please note that the data used in this project is static and does not update in real-time. This project serves as an educational resource for understanding the capabilities of Dash and data visualization techniques.
